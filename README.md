# IRF_Project

The purpose of this repository is to achieve a grade in the course: 'Internet Application Development'.

## App development plan

I am planning on developing an app that will read data about tulips from a CSV file
and then display them in a grid alongside a diagram about the
Area used for the production of flower bulbs in the Netherlands in 2019, by flower type,
based on the data from this chart https://www.statista.com/statistics/641919/total-area-used-for-production-flower-bulbs-in-the-netherlands-by-flower-type/.

I am also planning on using LINQ for a table where a search option would be provided for the flower types.

I will also need to use the Graphics class for a figure.
I will try to create something that resembles a tulip.
